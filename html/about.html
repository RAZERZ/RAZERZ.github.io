    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a <span class="currAge"></span><script>var year = new Date(new Date() - new Date("2002-04-28")).getFullYear() - 1970; document.getElementsByClassName("currAge")[0].innerHTML = year;</script>
        year old currently in high school in Karlstad, Sweden. During my freetime, I study for my pilots license as well as work on projects that either are of use to me, or makes someone else's life easier which is why I have chosen to mostly work on automation tools that are available completely free of charge.
    </p>
    <p>I prefer to work in an open source environment, which is why most of my projects are available on Github - Feel free to contribute.</p>
    <p>I have worked with a diverse set of programming languages and tools.</p>
