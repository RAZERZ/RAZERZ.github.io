    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a <span class="currAge"></span>
        year old currently in high school in Karlstad, Sweden. My parents originate from Lebanon, but I have lived in Sweden my whole life which is why I also speak Swedish in addition to French, Arabic, and English. During my freetime, I study for my pilots license as well as work on projects that either are of use to me, or makes someone else's life easier which is why I have chosen to mostly work on automation tools that are available completely free of charge.
    </p>
    <p>I prefer to work in an open source environment, which is why most of my projects are available on my <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://github.com/RAZERZ">Github</a> - Feel free to contribute.</p>
    <p>I have worked with a diverse set of programming languages and tools.</p>

    <p>Over the years, the understanding of these tools have built the foundation of my knowledgebase.</p>
    <p>Working as a webdeveloper opened my eyes to restrictions and workarounds. Somedays I had to use HTML to inject Javascript to edit and style the DOM to my will. Other days, it was the other way around. My previous knowledge of bypassing Samsung's Knox security could'nt even help me here.
    That's when my love for automation grew and I started to focus less on the object oriented languages (though I kept PHP since it is a really powerful language when combined with Javascript) and more on scripting languages.</p>
    <p>To this day, I'm still open to new programming techniques that can automate more than just the web.</p>
