    <h1>How have I contributed back?</h1>
    <p>Because of my diverse interests, I have set foot in many communities and met a lot of different people.</p>
    <p>Let't take a quick look at how I have contributed back to these communities.</p>

    <h2>XDA-Developers</h2>
    <p>This is where my programming career really took off. XDA served me with a lot of custom modifications and support until one day I asked myself how to reverse it.</p>
    <p>I started responding to forum questions that I could answer and hopefully, guide a lost soul in the right direction for troubleshooting.</p>
    <p>It turned out successful, but I wanted to give more, so I made some tools that automated some complicated processes when unbricking a tablet which turned into a great success.</p>
    <p>One thing that intrigued me was how custom operating systems could be flashed onto devices, and I wanted to try and make my own and share it with the community.</p>
    <p>On this journey, I discovered the dark secrets of the C language that I wish 15 year old me never saw but I was hooked.</p>
    <p>Couple of months later, while waiting for my plane at my airport and compiling the ROM, I got my first ever "Success!" after months of troubleshooting.</p>

    <p>I can't find the  picture of the success code but this picture was the best I could find. I wish I had a picture of my priceless expression. I flashed the ROM on my phone while still att the airport and everything was working.</p>
    <p>I had never felt so successful ever before, and knew by then that this was the "kick" I shall follow.</p>
