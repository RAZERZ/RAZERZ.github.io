    <h1>How have I contributed back?</h1>
    <p>Because of my diverse interests, I have set foot in many communities and met a lot of different people.</p>
    <p>Let't take a quick look at how I have used my programming skills to contribute back to these communities.</p>

    <h2>XDA-Developers</h2>
    <p>This is where my programming career really took off. XDA served me with a lot of custom modifications and support until one day I asked myself how to reverse it.</p>
    <p>I started responding to forum questions that I could answer and hopefully, guide a lost soul in the right direction for troubleshooting.</p>
    <p>It turned out successful, but I wanted to give more, so I made some tools that automated some complicated processes when unbricking a tablet which turned into a great success.</p>
    <p>One thing that intrigued me was how custom operating systems could be flashed onto devices, and I wanted to try and make my own and share it with the community.</p>
    <p>On this journey, I discovered the dark secrets of the C language that I wish 15 year old me never saw but I was hooked.</p>
    <p>Couple of months later, while waiting for my plane at my airport and compiling the ROM, I got my first ever "Success!" after months of troubleshooting.</p>
    <a title="It works!" href="extras/Personal/ramiabouzahra_20200106_2.jpg"><img style="width: 30%; height: auto; float: right; margin-left: 2%;" src="extras/Personal/ramiabouzahra_20200106_2.jpg"></a>
    <p>I can't find the  picture of the success code but this picture was the best I could find. I wish I had a picture of my priceless expression. I flashed the ROM on my phone while still att the airport and everything was working.</p>
    <p>I had never felt so successful ever before, and knew by then that this was the "kick" I shall follow.</p>

    <h2>Raspberry Pi</h2>
    <p>After I started checking out operating systems development, I was bound to get a RPI, and I did!</p>
    <p>I had never had so much fun with a computer before because I wasn't afraid of messing up. If I messed something up with the software I could easily start of with a fresh reinstall and if I messed something up with the hardware, well, the thing only costs 35$...</p>
    <p>Since I previously had to bypass Samsungs Knox security, I grew a little fond of "hacking" so I started looking for ways I could use my RPI to start learning.</p>
    <p>I picked up a few WiFi cards that were pretty good when it came to packet injection (wink wink) and got back to work.</p>
    <p>I found a very flexible and good OS for this, Backtrack 5 (called Kali linux today) but it didn't quite have what I was looking for. I was looking for a small package that packs a punch. That's when I found <a href="http://pwnpi.sourceforge.net/">pwnpi</a>.</p>
    <p>However, the installation was very complicated and it required multiple steps to update date and time and to even get the keyboard working. I knew that someone with less skills would not be able to research and figure this out, so I gave back by writing a little install script (which became one of my most famous repositories on Github)</p>
    <p>I later stopped hacking (unless I really need to) because people starting asking for crazy favours such as "could you hack facebook or Google?"</p>
    <p>Via an old 250GB hard drive, I turned the RPI into an FTP server as well as a database host for my projects. It was challenging nonetheless to set it up as a server, but I am glad I got something out of it.</p>

    <h2>Flight Simulation</h2>
    <p>Aviation has always been my true passion and motivation which is why I decided to join thousands of others via flight simulators.</p>
    <p>There were different VAs one could join (Virtual Airlines) and they all shared one common issue: where do we get the schedules from the real world airline?</p>
    <p>I wasn't aware of any of this until I was COO of a Scandinavian virtual airlines. The CEO was talking about how expensive a schedule pull was and then it hit me, why do we even have to pay for it when services like Flightradar24 are available for free?</p>
    <p>I set out to create the first completely free schedule puller and released it.</p>
    <p>It must've been the slowest release at the time and the tool didn't gain traction until nearly a year after (the project then probably started being indexed by search engines). It is now my most famous repository on Github. To this day I still get PMs wondering if I still support it and it always warms my heart that people are still using my tool.</p>

    <h2>Local Companies</h2>
    <p>I had the opportunity to work for a local company that wanted to desperately redesign their website, and they gave that project to me.</p>
    <p>There was only one issue, there was no way to edit the source code. You could only add HTML blocks, CSS, and Javascript which isn't that great of an issue, however previews where displayed in an iFrame which rendered some Javascript code completely useless.</p>
    <p>After around 6 months fighting with the CMS, the design was finally complete (and responsive!)</p>
    <p>While I was working with the design, a few sideprojects came up such as creating a ticketing system for repairs instead of paper trails with customer info. Safer, and faster!</p>
